# Angular-PHP-Imgur-Upload
A simple example of uploading an image using AngularJS front end through PHP backend to Imgur.

# Usage
First stable version is ready. Download the zip file and unpack it. Make sure a localhost is running which can handle PHP. Open up API/index.php and key in the Imgur key. Steps to register at Imgur coming soon. 

Thats it! Double click index.html, and upload an image. Image will be uploaded to Imgur via PHP and the URL of the image will be returned. This currently only supports anonymous uploads without user authentication.
